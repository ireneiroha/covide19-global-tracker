🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker Analysis
This project analyzes and visualizes global COVID-19 trends using real-world data. It tracks the virus's spread, death rates, and vaccination progress while offering insights into patterns across countries and time.

📚 Project Overview
Using data from Our World in Data, this project explores the global impact of COVID-19 through:

Trends in case growth and fatalities

Vaccination progress over time

Cross-country comparisons of critical health metrics

Key metrics analyzed:

Total cases and deaths

Death rate (total_deaths / total_cases)

Vaccination progress (% of population)

Cases per million people

🔧 Tools & Libraries
Python – Core analysis language

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive development

pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Static visualizations

Plotly – Interactive charts and maps

📁 Project Files

▶️ How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ireneiroha/covid19-global-tracker.git
cd covid19-global-tracker
Install dependencies:


pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
Open covid_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

Ensure the owid-covid-data.csv file is in the same directory, or update the path accordingly.

Run the notebook from start to finish to generate the analysis and visualizations.

🔍 Key Insights
Case Growth: The U.S. showed the steepest case rise, while countries like Kenya experienced slower growth.

Vaccination Rollout: High-income countries (e.g., U.S., U.K.) achieved faster vaccination coverage than lower-income nations.

Death Rates: Brazil recorded a high death rate; Germany had one of the lowest, likely due to stronger healthcare systems.

Global Patterns: Infection intensity varied regionally, emphasizing the need for localized policy responses.

📊 Visualizations Included
Line charts for cases, deaths, and vaccinations

Bar charts comparing countries

Death rate calculations
